Academico is an open-source, Lavarel-based school management platform. Its main features include course management, enrolments management, resources scheduling, reports and stats. It is primarily targeted at small and medium-sized institutions who need a simple and affordable solution to manage their school and courses.

See overview and features at https://academico.site

Demo available at http://demo.academico.site (use `admin@academico.site` with password `secret`)

If you're using this software, please be get in touch with project maintener to receive security updates. Just send an email to academico.platform@gmail.com (this is also very helpful for me to keep track of how many people actually use this software).

# Contributors welcome! ✨
This project was initially developed to address the needs of one specific school, however, the project is now published as open-source with the hope that others might use it. Developing and maintaining a new application takes a lot of time and effort, and everyone wins by using and improving already existing software instead of starting from scratch every time.

The project founder is still actively maintaining the code and fixing bugs on his spare time, however, the project would greatly benefit from new contributors. Contributing to this project is also a great way to train your developer skills. Some issues are available to beginners. Please see [this page on the wiki](https://github.com/laxsmi/academico/wiki/Development-Roadmap) for details.

Thanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):

# License
This software is based on Laravel and Backpack for Laravel. You will need to [acquire a Backpack license](https://backpackforlaravel.com/pricing) if you decide to use it for _commercial_ use. This is the recommended solution and Backpack does provide a nice, clean and easy CRUD panels throughout the application. Backpack for Laravel is kind enough to issue free licences for non-commercial projects.
